# Battle Trap

Battle trap is a single player and multiplayer game where you must last the longest in the board without coliding with another players trail. Inspired by Tron, players can move there player when it is their turn. 

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Multiplayer

Aiming to have multiplayer via P2P and Websockets. Websocket backend code is not in this repo or available at this time. P2P code will be included here.
